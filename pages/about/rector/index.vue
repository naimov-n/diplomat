                In relatively short period of time, our Institute made a

              Management System, augmentation of the number of students and
              programmes, MBA Programme and International ISO 9001:2015
              Certificate awarded by the International Organization for
              Standardization. The above achievements have become a testament to
              the institutionâ€™s unwavering dedication to provide its students
              with a world-class education and sustain the quality management
              standards. Our vision for Future MDIS Tashkent is an ambitious

              community via investment into better quality equipment and

              academic staff researchers and ensuring the quality of their

              scientific events as well as by increasing the number of research
              projects. Finally, it is important to highlight a remarkable role
              of the Governing Council of MDIS and UBA, which contributed
              greatly to the establishment and formation of the Institute by
              recruiting a team of dedicated specialists and practitioners from
              diverse fields of management and science. Think success, think
              MDIS. Yours faithfully, Dr. J.Salikhov Rector
