              <h2>Management Development Institute of Singapore</h2>
              <p style="padding-top: 16px;">
                Founded in 1956, the Management Development Institute of
                Singapore (MDIS) is Singapore’s oldest not-for-profit
                professional institute for lifelong learning. MDIS has two main
                subsidiaries: Management Development Institute of Singapore Pte
                Ltd which oversees its Singapore academic operations, and MDIS
                International Pte Ltd which focuses on MDIS’ globalisation
                strategy. MDIS offers internationally-accredited courses in
                Business and Management, Engineering, Fashion and Jewellery
                Design, Health and Nursing, Information Technology, Languages
                and Education, Life Sciences, Media and Communications,
                Psychology, Tourism and Hospitality Management, and Safety and
                Environmental Management. These programmes are offered in
                collaboration with renowned universities in the United Kingdom.
                MDIS is EduTrust certified, attesting to its exemplary education
                and business excellence standards. The institute was first
                awarded the certification in 2010 – subsequently renewed for
                four years in 2014 and 2018. MDIS was also one of the first
                Private Education Institutions (PEIs) to be registered under the
                Enhanced Registration Framework. The institute achieved a double
                win at the Singapore Prestige Brand Award (SPBA); it was one of
                four winners as well as the overall winner of the SPBA -
                Heritage Brands 2018. In 2017, MDIS was ranked 4th for the
                Enterprise 50 Award for its contributions in spurring
                Singapore’s economy. In 2019, MDIS had successfully transited
                from Singapore Service Class to Singapore Quality Class
                (Service) and is honoured to be one of the winners for the
                Corporate Merit Award at the Biennial Singapore Health Award.
                Continuing with its long-standing tradition of giving back to
                society, the MDIS Education Trust Fund (inaugurated in 1999)
                supports deserving students facing financial difficulties in
                pursuing their education in Singapore. To date, MDIS has awarded
                more than 8,000 scholarships and bursaries totalling over S$6
                million. The institute also actively supports several charities
                and provides community assistance, in reaching out to the young,
                elderly, and disabled. Equally vested in corporate-level
                training, MDIS’ corporate training arm, the Management
                Development and Consultancy, was set up in 1995 to cater to the
                training needs of the workforce. In 2014, MDIS acquired the
                Service Quality Centre to diversify its offerings in training
                solutions – in its endeavour to be a premium provider of
                training solutions in the region. Apart from the main Singapore
                campus, MDIS has international campuses in Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
                as well as in Johor, Malaysia. MDIS also has representative
                offices in India, and Indonesia, as well as agents throughout
                Southeast Asia.
